# boitata-deferred-renderer


Boitatah is a Vulkan based C++ Rendering Library.
It was started as a deferred renderer, and so named after the Brazilian folklore snake-like creature made of fire who illuminates the pampas. 
But evolved into being more flexible than that.

Currently still a work in progress.


## Instalation

Currently Boitata comes with example programs.
You can compile them running the compile.sh shell script.

This will also generate the library file.

## Roadmap

(currently)

[x] Basic Vulkan Interface

[x] Vulkan Buffer System

[x] Basic Renderer Interface (Backbuffer, Swapchain)

[x] GPU Resource System (GPUBuffers, Geometries, Textures, etc.)

[x] Camera System

[x] Material System

[ ] RenderGraph and flexible render loop.

[ ] Light System

[ ] The Deferred Renderer as mentioned above.
